Logistic Regression is a classification Machine Learning algorithm which can predict if a tumor is malignant or benign.
The famous Wisconsin Brest Cancer data from UCI Macchine Learning repository is used in this project. There are two classes of output variable which decides if the tumor is malignant or benign i.e., 2 and 4 respectively.
